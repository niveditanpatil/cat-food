# Cat Food Nutrition Optimizer

A Python application that calculates optimal food quantities for cats using linear programming to meet specific calorie and macronutrient targets.

## Features

- **Flexible Weight Units**: Accept weights in any unit (oz, lb, g, kg) and converts internally
- **Automatic Conversion**: All weight calculations are normalized to ounces
- **Linear Programming**: Uses scipy.optimize to find optimal quantities meeting:
  - Protein ‚â• 55%
  - Carbohydrates ‚â§ 2%
  - Fat ‚â• 45%
  - Treats ‚â§ 10% of total calories‚Å¥
- **Moisture Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts dry-matter nutritional values for wet foods
- **Treat Management**: Distinguishes between food and treats with automatic calorie limits
- **Interactive Selection**: User-friendly interface for selecting items and preferences
- **CSV Data Management**: Easy-to-edit CSV format for managing food items

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Default)

Run the application in interactive mode:
```bash
python main.py
```

The interactive mode provides a user-friendly interface that will:

1. **Display your cat's profile** based on `cat_config.csv`
2. **Show all available food items and treats** from `food_and_treats.csv` in a numbered list
3. **Let you select specific items** by entering their numbers (e.g., "1,3,5" or "1 3 5")
4. **Ask about treat preferences** (include at least one treat or optimize purely for nutrition)
5. **Confirm your selection** before calculating
6. **Calculate optimal quantities** and display formatted results

### Non-Interactive Mode

For automated use or scripting, use the `--non-interactive` flag:

```bash
python main.py --non-interactive
```

This mode will:
- Use all items from `food_and_treats.csv`
- Use default treat preferences (no forced treat inclusion)
- Output results in a simple format

### Configuring Your Cat's Profile

Edit `cat_config.csv` to set your cat's parameters:

```csv
parameter,value
weight_kg,5.5
activity,1
neutered,True
meal_count,4
```

**Parameters:**
- `weight_kg`: Your cat's weight in kilograms
- `activity`: Activity level (1=low/sedentary, 2=medium, 3=high/very active)
- `neutered`: Whether your cat is neutered (`True` or `False`)
- `meal_count`: Number of meals per day

Edit `cat_config.csv` to set your cat's profile:
```csv
parameter,value
weight_kg,5.5
activity,1
neutered,True
meal_count,4
```

**Parameters:**
- `weight_kg`: Your cat's weight in kilograms
- `activity`: Activity level (1=low/sedentary, 2=medium, 3=high/very active)
- `neutered`: Whether your cat is neutered (`True` or `False`)
- `meal_count`: Number of meals per day

### Adding Food Items and Treats

Edit `food_and_treats.csv` to add or modify food items and treats:

```csv
name,type,calories,weight,weight_unit,min_protein,max_fiber,min_fat,max_moisture,ash,max_carbs
```

**Columns:**
- `name`: Item identifier (e.g., "chicken", "salmon")
- `type`: Item type ('food' or 'treat') - treats limited to 10% of calories‚Å¥
- `calories`: Total calories in the given weight
- `weight`: Weight value
- `weight_unit`: Unit of measurement (`oz`, `lb`, `g`, `kg`, `grams`, etc.)
- `min_protein`: Protein percentage from label (as-fed)
- `max_fiber`: Fiber percentage from label (as-fed)
- `min_fat`: Fat percentage from label (as-fed)
- `max_moisture`: Moisture percentage from label (as-fed, 0 means already dry matter)
- `ash`: Ash percentage (as-fed) - typically 3% for canned food, 6% for dry food¬≥
- `max_carbs`: **Optional** - Direct carb percentage from label (as-fed). If empty, calculated from other values.

**Carbohydrate Options:**
1. **Provide directly:** Enter carb percentage in `max_carbs` column
2. **Auto-calculate:** Leave `max_carbs` empty, carbs calculated using:¬≥
```
Carbs = 100 - (Protein + Fat + Fiber + Moisture + Ash)
```

**Dry Matter Conversion:**
All label values are automatically converted to dry matter basis for fair comparison.‚Å¥

**Supported Weight Units:**
- `oz`, `ozs`, `ounce`, `ounces` - Ounces
- `lb`, `lbs`, `pound`, `pounds` - Pounds
- `g`, `gram`, `grams` - Grams
- `kg`, `kilogram`, `kilograms`, `kilo` - Kilograms

**Example:**
```csv
name,type,calories,weight,weight_unit,min_protein,max_fiber,min_fat,max_moisture,ash,max_carbs
chicken_pate,food,100,3,oz,10,1.5,5,78,3,
salmon_kibble,food,400,100,grams,35,2.5,15,8,6,
cat_treat,treat,15,0.5,oz,8,1,5,75,2,
special_with_carbs,food,350,200,grams,40,3,20,8,6,2.5
```

Notes:
- Empty `max_carbs` = calculate from other values
- Filled `max_carbs` = use direct value from label
- `max_moisture=0` = values already on dry matter basis
- `type=treat` = treats automatically limited to 10% of calories‚Å¥

### Customizing Macronutrient Targets

Edit `config.py` to adjust target percentages:

```python
MACRONUTRIENT_TARGETS = {
    'protein': 55,  # Minimum protein percentage
    'carbs': 2,     # Maximum carbohydrate percentage
    'fat': 45       # Minimum fat percentage
}
```

These targets are based on the natural diet of wild cats: approximately 55% protein, 45% fat, and 1-2% carbohydrates.¬π

## How It Works

### 1. Calorie Calculation (`calc_cal`)

Calculates daily calorie requirement per meal using the formula¬≤:
```
resting_energy_requirement = (30 √ó weight_kg + 70) √ó activity_multiplier
Daily Calories = resting_energy_requirement √ó (0.8 if neutered, else 1.0)
Per Meal = Daily Calories / meal_count
```

**Activity Levels:**
- `1`: Low activity (1.2x multiplier) - Sedentary
- `2`: Medium activity (1.5x multiplier) - Moderately Active
- `3`: High activity (2.0x multiplier) - Highly Active

**Neutering Adjustment:** Neutered pets have a lower energy requirement, so multiply the TER by 0.8 for neutered cats.¬≤

### 2. Optimization (`calc_quant`)

Uses a **two-stage optimization approach** for maximum efficiency and reliability:

**Stage 1: Standard Optimization**
- Uses linear programming to find optimal quantities without treat constraints
- Minimizes total quantity while meeting macronutrient targets
- Falls back to nonlinear optimization if linear programming fails

**Stage 2: Treat Inclusion (if requested)**
- Checks if Stage 1 already includes treats
- If not, uses **greedy substitution strategy**:
  - Tries substituting small amounts of food with treats
  - Maintains calorie balance and reasonable nutrition
  - Falls back to simple treat addition if substitution fails
- Ensures treats are limited to 10% of total calories

**Key Benefits:**
- **More reliable**: Avoids infeasible constraint combinations
- **Faster**: Two-stage approach is more efficient than complex single-stage optimization
- **Flexible**: Gracefully handles treat inclusion requests
- **Robust**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure solutions are found

### 3. Carbohydrate Calculation

Carbs are calculated from the guaranteed analysis using the formula from PetMD:¬≥
```python
carbs = 100 - (protein + fat + fiber + moisture + ash)
```

This is necessary because AAFCO regulations don't require carb reporting on labels.

**Important Note:**¬≥ Using crude fiber instead of total dietary fiber overestimates calculated carbs by approximately 21% on average (range: 3% to 93%). The optimizer accounts for this by adjusting calculated carb values downward when comparing to targets:
```python
adjusted_carbs = calculated_carbs * (1 - 0.21)
```

This ensures the optimization doesn't reject foods that actually meet carb targets but appear high due to the overestimation.

### 4. Treat Management

The optimizer distinguishes between food and treats to ensure proper nutrition:

- **Food**: Complete and balanced nutrition sources that can make up 90%+ of daily calories
- **Treats**: Limited to 10% of daily calories per [VCA Animal Hospitals](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-treats)‚Å¥

This constraint ensures that treats don't interfere with your cat's appetite for regular food or contribute to obesity, while still allowing for enrichment and bonding opportunities.

### 5. Dry Matter Basis Conversion

All foods are converted to dry matter basis for fair comparison, following TheCatSite methodology:‚Å¥
```python
dry_mass = 100 - moisture_percent
adjusted_macro = (as_fed_macro / dry_mass) √ó 100
```

**Special case:** If moisture = 0, values are assumed to already be on dry matter basis (no conversion applied).

This ensures wet foods (78% moisture) and dry foods (8% moisture) are compared fairly.
